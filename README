My research with Geoff Marcy involves spectroscopically measuring Carbon and
Oxygen abundances in ~1000 stars from the California Planet Search catalog.
Measuring the abundances requires fitting synthetic spectra generated by
a program called Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to Keck HIRES spectra.  SME
computes stellar spectra by solving the equations of radiative transfer using
a model atmosphere (taken from Kurucz).  The science is described in our paper
(preprint).

The radiative transfer simulated in C, wrapped in an IDL program.  It would 
have been impractical to re-write this codebase in Python.  However, the skills
I learned in the Python class proved valuable in interpreting and visualizing
my results.


####### General Purpose Modules ######

plotplus - Supplements matplotlib functionality

	 mergeAxes - Takes a figure multiple plots that share the abcissca.
	 	     standardizes the limits.  

	 errpt     - Overplot representitive errorbar on an axis.  The user
	 	     specifies the location of the errorbar in 
		     *device coordinates* - [0.1,0.1] is lower left

numplus  - Supplements numpy functionality
	 
	 binavg - Groups points into user specified bins and computes the
	 	  average in each bin.  I was surprized that I couldn't find
		  something that did this online.

PySIMBAD - Semi-automatic way of matching stars with the unique SIMBAD
	   identifier. This identifier is a handy way to match objects 
	   from different catalogs. Using this module is a two-step process.
	   
     (1) - Generate a scripted SIMBAD query with the `names2sim` method.  
       	   Converts array of names into a SIMBAD query.

     (2) - Upload the script to SIMBAD script page.  Download the output as
       	   a file.

     (3) - Parse the output file with `res2id` method.  The output will be two 
     	   tuples: the SIMBAD oid matched with the *index* of the star in the
	   names array.

fxwd     - Module for parsing fixed width data. 
	 
	 fxwd2rec - Converts fixed width data and returns record array.
	 	    Requires knowing the datatypes before runtime.


PyDL     - Lets the user interact with data stored in IDL .sav files.
	   idlobj class is an object oriented approach to data stored in IDL
	   structures.
