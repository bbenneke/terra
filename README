####### PYTHON FINAL PROJECT ######
###################################

My research with Geoff Marcy involves spectroscopically measuring Carbon and
Oxygen abundances in ~1000 stars from the California Planet Search catalog.
Measuring the abundances requires fitting synthetic spectra generated by
a program called Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to Keck HIRES spectra.  SME
computes stellar spectra by solving the equations of radiative transfer using
a model atmosphere (taken from Kurucz).  The science is described in our paper
(preprint).

The radiative transfer simulated in C, wrapped in an IDL program.  It would 
have been impractical to re-write this codebase in Python.  However, the skills
I learned in the Python class proved valuable in interpreting and visualizing
my results.


####### General Purpose Modules ######

plotplus - Supplements matplotlib functionality

	 mergeAxes - Takes a figure multiple plots that share the abcissca.
	 	     standardizes the limits.  

	 errpt     - Overplot representitive errorbar on an axis.  The user
	 	     specifies the location of the errorbar in 
		     *device coordinates* - [0.1,0.1] is lower left

numplus  - Supplements numpy functionality
	 
	 binavg - Groups points into user specified bins and computes the
	 	  average in each bin.  I was surprized that I couldn't find
		  something that did this online.

PySIMBAD - Semi-automatic way of matching stars with the unique SIMBAD
	   identifier. This identifier is a handy way to match objects 
	   from different catalogs. Using this module is a two-step process.
	   
     (1) - Generate a scripted SIMBAD query with the `names2sim` method.  
       	   Converts array of names into a SIMBAD query.

     (2) - Upload the script to SIMBAD script page.  Download the output as
       	   a file.

     (3) - Parse the output file with `res2id` method.  The output will be two 
     	   tuples: the SIMBAD oid matched with the *index* of the star in the
	   names array.

fxwd     - Module for parsing fixed width data. 
	 
	 fxwd2rec - Converts fixed width data and returns record array.
	 	    Requires knowing the datatypes before runtime.


PyDL     - Lets the user interact with data stored in IDL .sav files.
	   idlobj class is an object oriented approach to data stored in IDL
	   structures.  
	 


####### Analysis-specific Modules ######

starsdb - Builds a sqlite3 database that holds the following information:
	   * Results from my spectroscopic analysis
   
	   * Comparision results from the literature.  My sample
  	     shares some stars with previous studies.  Plotting
	     literatue abundances versus my own is a good check that my 
	     analysis is working properly.

           * Exoplanet information from exoplanets.org .  One of the
	     goals of my project is to investigate whether C or O 
	     affects planet occurance rate.

I connect to the database using the amazing sqlalchemy module.  This module
lets the user define pythonic objects and then maps the attribtues of these
objects to a database.  This is a much cleaner solution than writing all the
CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE solutions.  sqlalchemy also provides a pythonic way to
*query* the database, which is much cleaner than writing out the sql commands
as a string and porting them with the sqlite3 module.  However, I started
using SQLAlchemy late in my development process, so I did not have time to
incorporate the SQLAlchemy queries.


Outline:
   * Define a `stars` SQLAlchemy object which has attributes like: name,
     teff, c_abund, o_abund, etc...

   * Define short functions that specify how to read information in from
     various tables.  Most are built upon my fxwd module.

   * Insert data into SQLAlchemy object.  The database has been created.
